                    <span>
                        &emsp; Thank you for accepting me for who I am, and loving me willingly so. You mean so much to me and I can't be grateful enough that I am with you. I say that the world is unfair, and I still think it is, but it was fair enough to give me you. I am sorry for my shortcomings, I promise that I love you with all my heart, and that this love is pure not of something bad.
                    </span>
                    <br> <br>
                    <span>
                        &emsp;  I want to marry you once we're both secured and ready, please trust me TvT. Though for now we cannot go on dates as much as we want, someday we'll look back and be at ease knowing that it's no longer an issue for us. Thank you for still being with me, even if I am me TvT. I love you.
                    </span>
