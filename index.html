                        &emsp; Thank you for accepting me for who I am, and loving me willingly so. You mean so much to me and I can't be grateful enough that I am with you. I say that the world is unfair, and I still think it is, but it was fair enough to give me you. I am sorry for my shortcomings, I promise that I love you with all my heart, and that this love is pure not of something bad. I want to marry you once we're both secured and ready, please trust me TvT. Though for now we cannot go on dates as much as we want, someday we'll look back and be at ease knowing that it's no longer an issue for us. Thank you for still being with me, even if I am me TvT.

And for times where you think you failed, just know that I am still proud, I am proud of your efforts and I think that you are super duper admirable. Thank you for inspiring me and motivating me to keep moving forward, I hope you can see how great you areeee.
